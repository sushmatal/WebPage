        Spring Transits is a company that aspires to enable women in a very unique and sustainable
        way, one cohort at a time, to pursue fulfilling technical careers in a flexible remote work
        setup. We build an overarching ecosystem for our cohorts to develop their skills, regain
        confidence, and pivot as needed. We match our people with mentors who help them grow
        exponentially through knowledge sharing and one-on-one coaching. Our grooming philosophy
        helps build a culture where a group of individuals gains experience in a safe and flexible
        setting. We team with our partners to work on real products and services helping
        our cohorts gain valuable experience in the marketplace. Our mission is to help women
        get back to the workforce with incredible confidence and right skills, we also want to be
        recognized as a company that deeply cares about the process of grooming individuals.
